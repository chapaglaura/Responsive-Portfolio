                My full name is <strong>Laura Chapa Gonz√°lez</strong>. I am <strong>24 years old</strong>, but when
                people ask me about my age I tell them I am much, much younger <i>(just kidding!)</i>. I have had a
                certain inclination for <span class="underlined">biology</span> and <span class="underlined">math</span>
                since I can remember. I used to dig for bugs and play with them, not cockroaches, though, those scare
                the bejesus out of me; I also liked to watch surgery videos and liked to know how the human body works.
                Due to all these likings, I decided to major at Biomedical Engineering, as it had everything I expected
                concerning the anatomical and physiological part of the human being and engineering subjects like math,
                science, chemistry, physics, etc.
                <br>
                I like a lot watching football, but mostly when the Mexican National Football team is playing. I used
                to play this sport and some others like basketball and volleyball. I completely <strong>ADORE</strong>
                dancing as I used to dance jazz, hip hop and ballet. There was a time where I had to juggle between
                basketball, jazz and ballet all in the same day, so you can pretty much say I was quite an active girl.
                <br>
